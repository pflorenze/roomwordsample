Android Room Codelab
My junior dev lesson of the day 

OnActivityResult method is Deprecated

Doing the Android Codelabs is a good way to gain more practice on Android (Kotlin).
I started the codelab “Room with a View” who consist in a simple app to save a word using
Room, ViewModel, and LiveData. But I found the method OnActivityResult method is deprecated.
Well like a self taught developer, and ad usual, I try to found by myself the solution when I the code is not working, and this is the challenge to solve.
Yes, certainly the deprecated method in Android is a constant opportunity to a beginner (like me) to improve my habilities to found a solution.
This is how I found the solution.
